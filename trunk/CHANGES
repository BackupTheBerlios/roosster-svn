Revision XX / 2005-02-XX / Benjamin Reitzammer

* fixed a bug in org.roosster.input.UrlFetcher that caused wrong 
  ContentTypeProcessor to be used, when ContentType was specified with Encoding
* removed JDOM dependency in EntryGenerator (ROME still needs JDOM)
* removed "app" Servlet from web.xml; this means the application (when run as 
  a web application is only available through the API)
* Implemented a rudimentary HTML Parser to extract text only from HTML pages, and
  use that as searchable content in index (uses TagSoup); is also used when 
  fetching feeds. --> added raw field to Lucene Document to still store complete
  URL's content
* added lastedit field to Entry and Document, gets updated automatically
* changed XML format, see doc/entry.xml for example of new structure
* API now allows to select output mode (specify 'output.mode' request parameter)
* standardized exception messages (for easy parsing and meaningful error Messages
  in JS Client)
