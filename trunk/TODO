GUI
========

* make it a native startable app for MacOS X with a decent menubar
* implement search history (for the current session only, for now)
* give locale to QueryParser

General
=======
* secure http server, make it only accessible from localhost
* handle network errors better
* clean up behaviour, when entries get added via a feed, and one of many entries
  of this feed is duplicate (currently throws Exception, when encountering
  duplicate, and dumping remaining entries), do it in EntryStore
