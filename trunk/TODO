GUI
========

* make it a native startable app for MacOS X with a decent menubar
* implement search history (for the current session only, for now)
* give locale to QueryParser
* implement LOG viewer
* implement custom analyzer
* implement simple search.html page
* show user when some action is being executed instead of only freezing the app

General
=======
* secure http server, make it only accessible from localhost
* handle network errors better, and handle status codes 301, 302, 4xx and 5xx 
* fix del.icio.us sync, where http://google.com gets added as http://google.com/
  and this messes up roosster
