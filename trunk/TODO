API
=========
* implement tag fetching

* DONE implement api method to retrieve number of entries (integrated in entrylist)
* DONE implement command to fetch only raw contents of entry

* DONE get rid of JDOM use in EntryGenerator


General
=========
* look at all TODO comments in sourcecode
* update roosster.app.version property
* move to MultiFieldQueryParser, remove Entry.ALL
* document when RAW is set, and what it means if it's not set
* handle Frames in HTMLProcessor see http://javaboutique.internet.com/tutorials/HTMLParser/article.html
* implement ContentTypeProcessor chains, should be triggered when certain 
  mime types are encountered
* implement property to enable forcing of a certain ContentTypeProcessor
* rewrite raw content to reflect image locations ...
* finish SyncDeliciousCommand
* implement HitList (see Otis mail) and make it return Entry objects
  (instantiated on the fly), use this in EntryList.class
* EntryList.class should only use HitList, for this always add offset
  to requested index (and throw IndexOutOfBoundsException, when
  requested index+offset is greater than limit)
* add property for HtmlMode template suffix/prefix
* use file locking in Configuration.persist() ?
* LATER Thinlet GUI http://thinlet.sf.net/ GUI Editor http://thing.sourc eforge.net/

* DONE make logging configurable by CLI switch
* DONE FIX THE FUCKING LOGGING ... I HATE COMMONS LOGGING
* DONE extend Entry so that content field contains only meaningful (no
  markup) text, while adding a new (unindexed, stored) field to
  Entry.class text, Return this "raw" field when cached contents is
  requested
* DONE parse Content's encoding properly out of Content-type header field
* DONE parse title from HTML into Entry.title
* DONE use HTML parser (jtidy or jsoup) to process HTML before adding
* DONE handle RAW field in XmlProcessor


Scratchpad Feature:
====================

* - make own url scheme
- add boolean attribute to Entry.class,
-  add search option (on extra page), to search only standalone notes,
-  show only standalone notes, add new tab for that


maybe
-  implement new Entry class, make Entry an interface and let the new  and old Entry class implement it
- this would make a Factory necessary,  Commons Discovery?
