GUI
========

* make it a native startable app for MacOS X with a decent menubar
* implement search history (for the current session only, for now)
* give locale to QueryParser
* implement LOG viewer
* show user when some action is being executed instead of freezing app

General
=======
* secure http server, make it only accessible from localhost
* handle network errors better, and handle status codes 301, 302, 4xx and 5xx
